# Verilog Beginner Projects – Digital Logic Design 💡

This repository contains my Verilog HDL implementations of basic digital logic modules. These beginner-level projects are part of my self-learning journey into digital electronics, FPGA design, and VLSI.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- [EDA Playground](https://edaplayground.com/) – for writing & simulating code  
- ModelSim (optional)  
- Vivado (future plan for synthesis)

---

## 📌 Learning Goals

- Understand RTL design and testbench writing in Verilog  
- Practice writing clean, modular code for basic digital blocks  
- Prepare for advanced digital design (FSM, ALU, UART, etc.)

---

## 🧪 Testbenches

Each module has a dedicated testbench to verify its output using:
- `$display`, `$monitor`
- Delay timing (`#10`)
- Stimulus generation and result display
